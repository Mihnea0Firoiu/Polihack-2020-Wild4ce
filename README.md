# Polihack-2020-Wild4ce
This is the project created by the team Wild4ce during Polihack 2020 hackathon.

We created a site which was supposed to help people treat minor wounds at home during pandemic as the medical system was really busy because of the COVID-19 emergency. Also, on the site you can find tutorials about how to offer the first aid.
